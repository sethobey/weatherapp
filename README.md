Coded up this example in roughly an hour more as a proof-of-concept using DarkSky API than anything else.
Could certainly use some UI touches, color, reponsive sizing, etc.

Packages:
Moment for UNIX time formatting
Font Awesome for weather icons
Axios to call backend server
Express on backend
DotEnv for environment variables
Request for HTTP client
